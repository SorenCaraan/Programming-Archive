Experiment #1: Centigrade Observations

1. When the program is run and 32 degrees Fahrenheit is entered the program responds with
a centigrade of 0 degrees.

2. 212 Fahrenheit ----> 100.000008 Centigrade, 77 Fahrenheit ----> 25.0000019 Centigrade

3. -460 Fahrenheit ----> -273.333344 Centigrade

4. “York,” the program responds with abnormal program termination

5. When “i” is removed from corresponding the program responds with “ The corresponding
Centigrade temperature is”

6. When “i” is remove from print the program says “unrecognized statement name at (1).”
In question #1 the program runs without errors, this time it has errors.

7. The program always gives a Centigrade of 0 when 5./9. Becomes 5/9.

8. When “write(*,*)” replaced “print*”, no changes occurred.

9. When “write(*,12)” and “12 format(10x,F6.1,A)” are applied to the program when the
temperature appeared, it was moved several spaces, when 10x and 6.1 where switched
