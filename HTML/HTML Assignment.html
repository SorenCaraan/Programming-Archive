<h2> Case Part #1 </h2>

<h3> Case Study Part #1: Short Summary </h3>

<p>
Jon Cabezas and Jacyln Fitch team up in order to create a business called the Altitude Online Corporation. 
</p>

<p>
<b> Their company focuses on six major areas: </b>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Online market optimization</li>
    <li>Customer insight</li>
    <li>Online marketing segmentation</li>
    <li>Online marketing ROI</li>
    <li>Effective Web design</li>
    <li>Online brand building</li>
</ul>

<p>
Jacylin contributes to with her experience in marketing, making the CEO of their company, while Jon's contributions are toward the technologies
section of their business. Altitude Outline depends on custom software to track Web site activity,
measure the use of streaming media and video, identifying target users in market segment and more.
Jaclyn and Jon have been busy developing corporate services and growing their business they are neglecting their own business information system <br>
Alitiude Online has inherited three corporate information systems divided amoung twelve locations across the country, its headquaters are located in New York. <br>
Jon, being the CIO of the company felt it was necessary for him to draw up a strategy and began a six-week mission to get information to begin an information system overhaul.
</p>

<h3> Case Part #1: Discussion and Findings</h3>

<p>
In order for Jon to make a change in an information overhaul, Jon is going to present a new problem that involves conflict, confusion and disruption. First of all, using different infotmation systems in different
branch locations is an issue. Using different systems and different locations would cause Jon and Jacyln to lose control of each location and cause supply chains to become messy. A solution to this problem would
be to implement an Enterprise Information System. The main use of an enterprise system is to allow interaction with both employees and third parties such as other businesses, external customers, suppliers and government agencies
An Enterprise Information System, would allow Jon and Jacyln to montior work flow within all branch locations and allow full control over the entire information system. This would increase efficiency and allow them to move on to other issues. 
</p>

<p>
Another thing to take into consideration is Jon's six-week trip and the information he is gathering in order to change their information systems. Jon needs to gather information based on how the other branch locations work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Here is a General Model of an Organization:</b>
</p>

<img src="General Model of an Organization.jpg" alt="Error" width="700" height="600">


<p>
Looking at the image there are Five main things that Jon has to focus on getting information on: montioring and control, outputs, inputs, the environment and the transfromation process. Inputs and output are important, since their company needs
tools to use. Something Jon should consider is to use a value chain. Value chains allow a company to take a chain or series of actions in order to transform their inputs and outputs. Jon needs to gather information about his company's assets. Information
such as what methods each branch uses in their information systems, what he and his co-workers have access to like customer feedback, advertising or what market strategies they use. While a value chain would be more useful in compaines that manufacture products, 
service companies like Altitude Online, can still make use of this strategy by adding a significant amount of value to their services to help with success. Jon mainly needs to focus on what his company has to work with and reorganizing the companies methods, before 
adding bigger changes. 
</p>

<p>
Now that Jon is gathering information that he needs to optimzie the companies performance, a good idea would be to apply what he knows about the Lewin's Change Model and Leavitt's Diamond. The Lewin's Change Model is a three-staged approach for implememnting that involves 
unfreezing, moving and refreezing. Unfreezing requires planning, defining objectives to success and drawing on others for ideas. Moving is stage where Jon needs to motivate co-workers involved with the change and providing appropriate resources. The last stage, refreezing is where the change is occuring where Jon is establishing controlls to make sure that change
is occuring and to reorganize issues with the transition to change, give feedback to individuals who need help adjusting and to montior progress for success.
While this is all happening Jon should also review Leavitt's Diamond. Leavitt's Diamond is a model that states that any change to its four factors of technology, people, task or structure will necessitate a change to the other three factors. If technology resources change then taks, people and structure will also
have to change. It is similar to the "domino effect," but this case Jon needs to control every factor in the Leavitt's Diamond as he makes the changes for his information systems overhaul. Knowing all this can help Jon apply his knowledge with his resources to reorganize the business's information system.
</p>

<h3>
<b>
Case Part #1 Conclusion
</b>
</h3>

<p>
If Jon can do all of this correctly, taking into account all of this preparation and implementing all his resources to change, then Jon can successful overhaul the information systems he has with Jacyln. He must remember what knowledge he has, what the company has to work with and how to implement the change properly and efficiently. Once Jon has gone through this process, all he needs to do 
is to montior how the company is adapting to this change. With all that Altitude Online is good to contiune using their services.

<h2> Case Part #2 </h2>

<h3> Case Study Part #2: Short Summary </h3>

<p>
Jon's first step to making Alitiude Online's complete information system is to define its system's requirements: "What will this system do for the company?" In order to do this Jon consults system adminstrators and business managers in the other four locations to figure out what they should do. After consulting the adminstrators and the managers, they all come to a consensus
use a Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System. An ERP system is a system that manages all a company's corporate resources, information and functions across all business areas. These systems are typically provided by information system compaines, such as SAP, Oracle, Microsoft Dynamics and more. Altitude Online is considering compaines like SAP, since they could benefit in may of
those areas. Altitude intends to store both static and video formats and needs media software for advertising development. Jon and his team decide to request bids from the top three companies for the job and Jon, his assistant and each sytem adminstrator set off to branch offices for groundwork for ERP installation.

<h3> Case Part #2: Discussion and Findings</h3>

<p>
Jon and his team's idea on using an ERP system is a good idea. Another method that they could use is to link up all exisitng corporate systems, which would be a bad idea. ERP systems have a lot of advantages over connecting the entire system into one. Advantages include elminating costs, primarily on older systems, the work process is improve, since another company is managing system maintence 
and an opportunity to upgrade technology resources as the company improves. This can help Jon and his team focus on other issues the company has like improving services and analyzing work flow. Infromation systems also require needing to be user friendly, so that they are easier to use. In Altitude Online's case since they are a company that specializes in services, with little to no maufacturing 
The ERP software would be most benefical for them in terms of usability. While Jon and his team could easily just connect all the current information systems that they have currently, an Enterprise Resource Planning System looks to be more benefical. 
<br>
<br>
Here is a List of all the benefits and drawbacks to the systems they could use:
</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System Benefits </th>
    <th>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System Drawbacks </th>
    <th>Linked Corporate System Benefits </th>
    <th>Linked Corporate System Drawbacks </th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> - Customizable </td>
    <td> - Complicated </td>
    <td> - Self-Sustained (You made, you decide everything it does) </td>
    <td> - Difficult to Maintain</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> - Greater Control on Overall System </td>
    <td> - Need to Hire Other Company to Manage </td>
    <td> - Easier to Implement </td>
    <td> - More Time Consuming than ERP systems </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> - Secure </td>
    <td> - Costly </td>
    <td> - Employees are used to the System </td>
    <td> - Difficult to Implement Newer Technology in the Future </td>
</table>


<p>
Jon has the right idea of using a Enterprise Resource System, however Altitude Online must consider what type to use. Since Jon has established for the most part what he wants the software to do for his company, it would be a good idea for him to get a custom-based ERP, rather than an out-of-the-box ERP. Altitude Online requires a system that has servers to store online ads in both static and video formats. They
have also stated that they need software for developing the ads that they are storing, as well as analytics software for tracking usage and marketing campaigns. Jon states that he wants a new website that offers rubust automated services to potential and current clients. Altitude Online has already set up their preferences and needs for the company's new information system. Considering this it would be best if the
company use a custom ERP rather than an out-of-the-box one. While an out-of-the-box ERP is more easy to use and is clean and intuitive, since Altitude and Jon have their system requirements and Jon is preparing for a big overhaul, it would be better for them to use a custom system, since it would allow them to control jow the system would work.
</p>

<p>
Something else that Altitude Online can consider is to use thier own system, instead of going to an ERP company. While Jon is fully qualified and has system adminstrators and managers posted at other locations, developing a software system would be difficult at best. The current system they have is not perfect and the reason that they are going for an ERP company is to find a system that is best suited to the company's 
needs. A new system that they develop is a good idea, but the drawbacks are very difficult for the company to work with. The current system is not working out for them which is thier own and it would be difficult for them to create a new system all oer again. ERP systems already offer a lot more benefits for them, and they have already have a consenus. The main reason that Altitude Online would not go for a system from scratch
is due to the fact they cannot develop a system themselves that would work with all tewlve locations the company has. 
</p>

<h3> Case Part #2: Conclusion </h3>

<p>
An Enterprise Resource Planning System, is the best chance the company has for success, since the current system needs a big overhaul. Sure the company could develop a new system from scratch or use an out-of-the-box system, but a custom ERP would suit the company's needs. Jon and his team have the right idea and should be able to make work more efficient and have an easy to use system if they look for the correct system that the 
companies are offering. Jon and his team just need to consider what they need and which company's tools align with their requirements.
